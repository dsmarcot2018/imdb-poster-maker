# IMDB API Automatic Poster Maker

This was a project done as a test for an internship. The program is meant to take in a keyword from the user and find the most relevant result on IMDB and make a poster for it. It works the best with TV shows and there may be some bugs.

Once the program receives the keyword it will then find 4 things
  1. A cover photo
  2. The title of the show
  3. The years that show aired
  4. The current ranking of the show on IMDB

## To run:
  1. Open as a flask project in Pycharm
  2. Make sure the Python requests package is installed
  3. Run App.py
  4. Open or reload Overlay.html
  5. Input the keyword you would like to search for
  6. Look at your new masterpiece
